# SASS: Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets

# .sass vs .scss
- .sass files omits curly braces and instead uses indentation
- .scss files still keeps both braces and indentation like regular css files

## Partials
- Partials are smaller .sass/.scss files that can be imported in other files. 

- Name partials with an underscore _ at the beginning to signify the SASS compiler that we do not want to generate respective .css files for them
